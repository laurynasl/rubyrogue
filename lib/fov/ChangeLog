	* configure.in, **/Makefile.am, aclocal.m4: Updated to work with
	automake 1.10.

	* COPYING: Changed from BSD license to MIT license (more liberal).

2006-03-04  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>
 
	* tests/testfov.cc, fov/fov.c: Fixed lighting correctness for
	angles when orthogonally behind a single tile wall, at a distance.
  
	* tests/testfov.cc, fov/fov.c: Fixed a double-free memory errory.
	Test and fix cycle. Now pretty confident the library now has no
	memory problems.

2006-03-02  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* fov/fov.c: Ran splint on fov.c and fixed up code to remove all
	warnings.

2006-02-14  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* configure.in, docs: Fixed Doxygen documentation detection and
	creation (yet to test on Cygwin).

2006-02-09  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* src/fov.c: Implemented beams!! They look like fun. Can somebody
	now make a Desperados or Commandos-style roguelike game with
	guards carrying torches and pacing up and down?

	* tests/fovtest.cpp, examples/simple.cpp, examples/map.cpp:
	Renamed *.cpp to *.cc.
	
	* configure.in: Spelled "Debbugging" correctly. *blush*

	* tests/fovtest.cpp: Organised tests better and made them defer
	their error output until they've all run so they don't muck up the
	nice progress meter.

	* example/simple.cpp: Now demos beams and prints keyboard usage
	when you press 'h' on the keyboard.

	* src/fov.c: Eliminated the need to call separate code for
	diagonal lines. These are now applied in by the beam casting
	function in a similar manner to the orthogonal lines.

	* src/fov.h: Renamed many functions to be a little more O-O
	inspired by including, for example "fov_settings" on the front of
	any function that operates upon a fov_settings_type data structure
	and takes a pointer to such a data structure as its first argument
	(like "this" in C++).

2006-02-07  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* src/fov.c: Turned on more GCC warning flags & eliminated many
	GCC warnings.

	* src/fov.h, src/fov.c: Eliminated global variables. They are now
	kept in a "settings" data structure that must be initialised by
	the user, freed if pre-calcualtion is used, and is passed around
	internally within the library.

	* src/fov.c: Halved the opacity test frequency for straight lines
	emanating from the data source (was 4 per tile, now 2 per tile).

2006-02-04  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* src/fov.c: Incorporated Joni Yrjana's patch to fix memcpy use,
	cast 8 octants instead of 9 (whoops) and fix a bug causing many
	more calls to opaque than necessary.

	* src/fov.c: Improved "square" FOV's diagonal limits.

	* src/fov.c: Standardised usage of x and rx in octant macro for
	greater clarity. rx is sometimes set to "x" and sometimes to "y"
	in the macro to swap the axes and mirror an octant on a diagonal
	axis.

	* src/fov.c: Standardised C code style a bit more (more
	underscores, less camelCase, curly brackets never omitted).

	* tests/fovtest.cpp: Started a set of unit test cases.

	* src/fov.c: Replaced horizontal and vertical beams with flags to
	octant functions so that every 2nd octant function lights the
	"edge", removing the need for separate calls. Diagonal beams
	are still cast separately although I may change this in future so
	everything is done with the octant functions as this would
	avoid the need to calculate the diagonal beam length.

2004-07-11  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* examples/simple.cpp: Added more comments to explain usage.

	* src/fov.c: Fixed to remove two errors on Dev-C++ 4.9.8.9:
		105: invalid conversion from 'void* to 'unsigned int*'
		117: invalid conversion from 'void* to 'unsigned int**'

2004-01-18  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* src/fov.c: Introduced hack to fix problem with broken lines when
	dy0 > dy1. Now produces correct appearance, however this problem
	needs closer examination.

2003-09-10  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* src/fov.c: Moved bool prevBlocked to top of define -> ANSI C.

2003-08-28  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* src/fov.c: Corrected octagonal limit (diagonal lines were
	  overshooting the rest of the FOV).

	* src/fov.h: Simplified API.

2003-08-27  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* src/simple.cpp: Implemented keys to toggle all library options.

	* src/angle.h, src/direction8.h: Amalgamated into fov.h.

	* src/fov.h, src/fov.c: Make radius limit a parameter of
	  fov_circle so it can be changed on the fly.

	* src/fov.h, src/fov.c: Implemented:
		- 4 different methods for limiting the FOV
			- precalculated circle
			- circle (Pythagorean)
			- octagon
			- square
		- Ability to prevent apply callback being called on opaque
		  tiles.

2003-08-15  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* src/shadowcast.*: Moved to src/shadowcast/ to remove it from
	Doxygen API.

2003-06-19  Greg McIntyre  <greg@puyo.cjb.net>

	* New C roguelike field-of-view library.
