======== Starting ==========

./run

If that fails, probably $COLORTERM is not set in environment. Try running:

./launch games/test/game.yaml


======== Crashes ============

Yes, game is crashing. That is because I commented out all rescue's, because I want to find all exceptions. It is far from alpha and non-playable.

======== Tests =============

For testing I use RSpec.
